# Smart Things- Initial State: Weather Data through WUnderground API

This code is a modified version of original code posted by Initial State Official Repo. on https://github.com/InitialState/wunderground-sensehat/blob/master/wunderground.py

The purpose of this code is help display weather data along with readings from Smart Things Devices (ex. temperature sensors and humidity sensors). 

This is done by fetching weather data from WUnderground through their API and sending it through Initial State Streamer Python Module (ISStreamer). 

This code is based on Python 3.5

You require the following python modules

-ISStreamer Python Module (Installation of Python Module is explained on https://github.com/InitialState/python_appender)


The updates from the original code are

-Updated it to work for Python 3.5
-Updated it to append the smart things data bucket
